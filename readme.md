## FEAT GEN BACKEND

Backend for the feat generator website. This handles user/feat/stat/skill data as well as the actual generator code.


TODO: 
    Make the generator code a little simpler/more robust. IT DOES do the job well, but I am at a point in my project where I am reasonably happy with how the frontend is right now and want to refactor it.
